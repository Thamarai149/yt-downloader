# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The YouTube Downloader application is currently deployed on Render.com but returns a "Not Found" error when accessed. This feature aims to diagnose and fix the deployment configuration issues to ensure the application loads correctly on the deployed URL.

## Glossary

- **Frontend Application**: The React-based client application built with Vite
- **Static Site Deployment**: The hosting of pre-built static files (HTML, CSS, JS) on Render.com
- **Build Output**: The compiled production files generated by Vite in the `dist` directory
- **Routing Configuration**: The setup that determines how URLs are handled by the web server
- **SPA (Single Page Application)**: A web application that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates content

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access the deployed application URL and see the homepage, so that I can use the YouTube downloader from any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the deployed URL, THE Frontend Application SHALL display the homepage within 5 seconds
2. WHEN the build process completes, THE Frontend Application SHALL generate all required static files in the dist directory
3. THE Frontend Application SHALL include a valid index.html file as the entry point
4. THE Frontend Application SHALL configure the web server to serve the SPA correctly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build configuration to be correct, so that the deployment process generates valid production files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Frontend Application SHALL use the correct base path configuration for Render.com deployment
2. THE Frontend Application SHALL include all necessary assets (CSS, JS, images) in the build output
3. WHEN the build command runs, THE Frontend Application SHALL complete without errors
4. THE Frontend Application SHALL generate a manifest.json file for PWA functionality

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want client-side routing to work correctly, so that I can navigate between different pages without getting 404 errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses any route directly, THE Frontend Application SHALL serve the index.html file
2. THE Frontend Application SHALL include a _redirects or equivalent configuration file for SPA routing
3. WHEN a user refreshes the page on any route, THE Frontend Application SHALL maintain the current page state
4. THE Frontend Application SHALL handle 404 errors gracefully by redirecting to the index page

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify the deployment configuration, so that I can ensure all settings are correct before deploying.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Frontend Application SHALL have the correct root directory set to "client" in Render.com settings
2. THE Frontend Application SHALL use the build command "npm install && npm run build"
3. THE Frontend Application SHALL set the publish directory to "dist"
4. WHERE environment variables are required, THE Frontend Application SHALL have VITE_BACKEND_URL configured correctly
